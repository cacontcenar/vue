Microsoft Flight Simulator X is a popular flight simulation video game that was released in 2006. It features realistic graphics, physics, and weather effects, as well as a variety of missions and challenges. If you want to install this game on your PC, you will need two ISO files: FSX Disk 1iso and FSX Disk 2iso.

In this article, we will show you how to install Microsoft Flight Simulator X from FSX Disk 1iso and FSX Disk 2iso using Windows 10. You will also need a DVD key to activate the game, which you can find online or on the back of your game box. Alternatively, you can use the trial version of the game and then install the Acceleration expansion pack, which includes a crack to bypass the activation process[^2^].
 
## Step 1: Mount FSX Disk 1iso
 
To mount an ISO file means to create a virtual drive on your computer that acts like a real disc drive. This way, you can access the contents of the ISO file without burning it to a physical disc. Windows 10 has a built-in feature that allows you to mount ISO files by simply double-clicking them. If you are using an older version of Windows, you will need to install a third-party software such as Daemon Tools or WinCDEmu to mount ISO files.
 
To mount FSX Disk 1iso, follow these steps:
 
- Locate the FSX Disk 1iso file on your computer and double-click it.
- A new window will pop up asking you to select a drive letter for the virtual drive. Choose any letter that is not already in use by another drive.
- Click OK and wait for the virtual drive to be created.
- You should see a new drive appear in your File Explorer with the label "FSX". This is your mounted FSX Disk 1iso.

## Step 2: Install Microsoft Flight Simulator X
 
Now that you have mounted FSX Disk 1iso, you can proceed to install Microsoft Flight Simulator X on your PC. To do this, follow these steps:

- Open your File Explorer and go to the virtual drive that contains FSX Disk 1iso.
- Double-click the setup.exe file to launch the installation wizard.
- Follow the on-screen instructions and accept the terms and conditions.
- When prompted, enter your DVD key or choose the trial option.
- Select the destination folder for the game and click Next.
- The installation process will begin and may take several minutes depending on your system specifications.
- When the installation is almost done, you will be asked to insert FSX Disk 2. This is where you need to mount FSX Disk 2iso using the same method as before.
- Once you have mounted FSX Disk 2iso, click OK and wait for the installation to finish.
- Click Finish and exit the installation wizard.

## Step 3: Enjoy Microsoft Flight Simulator X
 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed Microsoft Flight Simulator X from FSX Disk 1iso and FSX Disk 2iso. You can now launch the game from your Start menu or desktop shortcut and enjoy flying around the world. You can also customize your settings, download additional aircrafts and scenery, or try out different missions and challenges.
 
If you want to enhance your gaming experience, you can also install the Acceleration expansion pack, which adds new features and content to Microsoft Flight Simulator X. You can download it from this link[^3^] and use a magnet link to get a crack file that will allow you to play without activation[^2^]. Just follow the instructions in the README file and enjoy!
