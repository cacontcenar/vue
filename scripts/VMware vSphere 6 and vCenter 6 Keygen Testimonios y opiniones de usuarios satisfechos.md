VMware vSphere 6 and vCenter 6 are the latest versions of VMware's virtualization platform and management service, which transform data centers into aggregated computing infrastructures that include CPU, storage, and networking resources. In this article, we will explore some of the new features and benefits of VMware vSphere 6 and vCenter 6, and how to upgrade from previous versions.
 
## New Features and Benefits of VMware vSphere 6 and vCenter 6
 
VMware vSphere 6 and vCenter 6 introduce many enhancements and improvements that make virtualization more efficient, scalable, secure, and reliable. Some of the key features and benefits are:

- **vSphere with Tanzu**: This feature enables you to run Kubernetes workloads natively on the hypervisor layer, transforming vSphere into a platform for modern applications. You can deploy vSphere Pods, VMs, and upstream Kubernetes clusters through Tanzu Kubernetes Grid with vSphere, and manage them with a unified interface. You can also leverage vSphere Zones to provide high availability to your workloads at cluster level.
- **vSphere Distributed Services Engine**: This feature provides the ability to offload some of the infrastructure functions from a server CPU to a data processing unit (DPU), which is a device that features multiple embedded CPU cores, memory, and a trimmed version of an ESXi hypervisor. DPUs can be used for network acceleration, security, storage services, and more. You can manage the life cycle of the software and firmware that runs on a DPU device by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager images workflows.
- **vSphere Lifecycle Manager**: This feature simplifies and streamlines the management of ESXi hosts by using images and baselines at the cluster level. You can also use vSphere Configuration Profiles to manage the configuration of the hosts in a cluster collectively. You can apply a desired configuration to all hosts in a cluster in a single operation.
- **Cross-vCenter Migration and Clone**: This feature allows you to migrate or clone virtual machines between vCenter Server instances without shared storage or network connectivity. You can perform cross-vCenter vMotion, Storage vMotion, cold migration, or hot migration. You can also perform cross-vCenter mixed-version vMotion if the source and destination vCenters are on the same version.

## How to Upgrade to VMware vSphere 6 and vCenter 6
 
If you are running an older version of VMware vSphere or vCenter, you can upgrade to VMware vSphere 6 and vCenter 6 by following these steps:

1. Check the compatibility and interoperability of your hardware, software, and licenses with VMware Product Interoperability Matrices.
2. Review the upgrade best practices and prerequisites in VMware vSphere Upgrade Documentation.
3. Download the VMware vSphere 6 and vCenter 6 installation media from VMware Downloads.
4. Upgrade your vCenter Server appliance or install a new one. The vCenter Server appliance contains all the Platform Services Controller services from earlier releases, preserving all previous functionality, including authentication, certificate management, and licensing.
5. Upgrade your ESXi hosts by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager images or baselines.
6. Upgrade your virtual machines and virtual appliances by using VMware Toolsâ¢ and virtual hardware compatibility.
